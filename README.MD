AnyoneAI aims to democratize AI education by providing an intuitive and interactive platform to gain a solid understanding of AI and learn how to solve problems with it. The platform will provide lab-based tutorials where the learners will build their own AI models as they learn, and be able to see the "actual python code" of the model automatically generated as they build.
<br>
<br>
The short "10 minutes" micro tutorials are specifically designed for learners to quickly learn and invest in themselves in small pockets of time spread throughout the day.

## Future Plans
  While the current live lab-tutorials in the platform are thoughtfully made to work on any low-end computer, we are looking forward to going a step ahead in democratization of AI by providing free temporary cloud compute instances for users to run their AI code online and get results immediately (feature partially built [using GCP] and available in current version though not active).
